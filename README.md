# Retail-Shop-Network
This project simulates the network infrastructure of a retail shop using Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes the design and configuration of interconnected devices such as routers, switches, PCs, and servers to emulate various departments like billing, inventory, and administration. The network features include static and dynamic IP addressing, VLAN segmentation for departmental isolation, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, and internet access through a simulated ISP. This setup demonstrates core networking concepts and provides a realistic model of a small-to-medium scale retail environment.
